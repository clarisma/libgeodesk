This release supports Version 2.0 of the Geo-Object Library (GOL) file format.

**Important:** GOL 2.0 is incompatible with GOL 1.0. To create GOLs from OSM data, use GOL Tool 2.0 ([download`](https://www.geodesk.com/download) â€¢ [repo](https://github.com/clarisma/geodesk-gol)).

For backward compatibility, we will maintain Versions 1.x on branch `v1`.

The public API remains unchanged.

## Breaking changes

- Requires GOLs created with [GOL Tool 2.0](https://github.com/clarisma/geodesk-gol)

## Enhancements

- GOLs can now optionally store IDs for *all* nodes

## Performance enhancements

- Queries are typically 6% faster due to efficiency improvements in the GOL 2.0 file format
