## New functionality

- Parent queries (#1)

- Support for sharing `Features` across multiple threads (#15)

## Performance enhancements

- Tags can now be looked up using a precomputed `Key`, 
  resulting in a 2x to 4x speedup (Thanks @pbsurf for the initial implementation)

## Bug fixes

- Fixed FeatureUtils::isEmpty()  (#7)

- Fixed stack overflow when processing areas with sub-areas in a reference cycle (geodesk-py#63)
