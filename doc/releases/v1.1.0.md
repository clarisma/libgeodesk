We will be updating the GOL file format in Version 2.0.

To ensure compatibility, applications that need to read GOL 1.0 files can continue using the 1.x codebase, maintained on the `v1` branch.

## Bug fixes

- Non-strict `Decimal` parsing now accepts trailing zeroes, in accordance with the specification.

## Deprecations

- Beginning with Version 2.0, the GOL 1.0 file format will no longer be supported.
